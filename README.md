## Abstract

Pet ownership is arguably one of the more enjoyable aspects of life. Our furry friends provide us with joy, companionship, and love, and have generally been shown to improve the mental health and happiness of their owners. However, the owner also has an obligation to keep the pet healthy and happy, which often involves providing entertainment and exercise. Dogs can be easily entertained by a once-a-day walk, but cats are a different type of animal. They usually need some sort of chase or interactive play style and can often be hard to motivate. Couple this with the fact that most pet owners work long hours at a job all day and don’t have time to spend hours entertaining their cat, and you can see how cat obesity can easily be an issue.  

Our device, the Motorized Interactive Cat Exerciser (or MICE, for short), seeks to address this aspect of pet ownership. The device consists of a base with two wheels controlled by DC motors, several ultrasonic sensors, an RFID sensor paired with an RFID tag to be attached to the cat’s collar, and a cat toy with food mounted on top. The entire device is controlled by an Arduino Uno development board and is designed to provide cats with an interactive play experience. The device moves around the room, avoiding the cat via the RFID tag and avoiding walls and other obstacles via the ultrasonic sensors. If the cat can catch the device and bat at the toy, food will be released. This ensures the cat’s participation, and provides a healthy reward for the cat, promoting extended periods of chase. The device is completely autonomous, meaning the owner does not need to be present to entertain the cat or control the device. As such, we expect this product to help provide additional accessibility to healthy pet ownership.
